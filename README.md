# Basic sentiment analysis web app

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project is a web-based Sentiment Analysis application designed to analyze and determine the sentiment of user-provided text. Built with Flask, NLTK, and Bootstrap, the application is deployed in a serverless environment using Google Cloud Run, ensuring scalability and cost-effectiveness.

<h2>Features</h2>
Real-time Sentiment Analysis: Quickly analyze the sentiment of any text input (Positive, Negative, Neutral).<br>
Interactive UI: User-friendly interface developed with Bootstrap for a responsive and modern look.<br>
Serverless Deployment: Leveraging Google Cloud Run for a fully managed serverless experience, allowing automatic scaling based on demand.<br>
Natural Language Processing: Utilizing NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for robust sentiment analysis and text processing.<br>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
Backend: Flask - a lightweight WSGI web application framework.<br>
Frontend: Bootstrap - for responsive and mobile-first front-end web development.<br>
NLP: NLTK - a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.<br>
Deployment: Google Cloud Run - a managed compute platform that automatically scales your stateless containers.<br>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
Input Text: Users input text into the web interface.<br>
Text Processing: The text is processed using NLTK to clean and prepare it for analysis.<br>
Sentiment Analysis: The processed text is analyzed to determine its sentiment.<br>
Output: The result is displayed on the web interface, indicating whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.<br>
